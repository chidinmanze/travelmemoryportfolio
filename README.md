# Responsive Travel Portfolio
https://chidinmanze.github.io/travelmemoryportfolio/index.html

The goal of this project was to create a responsive portfolio website. I did this using the Bootsrap grid system. The displays well on devices of all sizes.

This activity was a great learning experience. The most interesting thing I learned was that a button can't be nested in an a href link in HTML 5. Though the link works, it creates a validation error. To work around this, used a Javascript "onclick" function.
 
## Clarification
On the Contact page, the "Send" button links to a "Thank You" confirmation page, but the info entered in the form is not actually submitted anywhere as the site is not connected anywhere on the back end.
